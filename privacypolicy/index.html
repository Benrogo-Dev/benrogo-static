            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> The only personal data collected by Benrogo is domains submitted to BYOD.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> On the proxy network itself, anonymous information such as IP addresses, sites visited (domains only), request count, 
            and request size are collected automatically. Domains and IP addresses are <strong>never</strong> publicly shown and used only for diagnostic purposes.
            Request count, size, and the proxy sites visited are summarized and added together to be shown on the home and linkies pages.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            <li><strong>To Improve User Experience:</strong> Information is analyzed and turned into statistics to improve the stability and speed of the proxy network, 
            and to aid in future design choices.</li>
            <li><strong>To Help Diagnose Problems:</strong> Anonymized data from the proxy network is used to help people fix problems with their sites, or to

        <h2>3. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Benrogo's privacy policy does not apply to other websites Benrogo is partnered with or any sites not managed by Benrogo, including BYOD (Bring Your Own Domain) links.

    <section>
        <h2>4. Logging Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Logs collected by the Benrogo proxy network are stripped of all but necessary information 1 week after being created, after which the
                stripped logs are indefinitely stored in a local encrypted archive. These archived logs are only used in the event that a rebuild of
                the database is required due to serious system issues, meaning they are unavailable to be used for troubleshooting. The encryption
                keys for these archives are stored in a secure location with protected access.</li>
            <li>Log files are never stored on equipment not owned by Benrogo and all transfers between equipment are encrypted.</li>
            <li>Logs are never sold or shown to third-parties, even in the event that they are needed for troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>
