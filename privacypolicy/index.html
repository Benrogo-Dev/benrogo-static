        <ul>

        <h2>4. Logging Policies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Logs collected by the Benrogo proxy network are stripped of all but necessary information 1 week after being created, after which the
                stripped logs are indefinitely stored in a local encrypted archive. These archived logs are only used in the event that a rebuild of
                the database is required due to serious system issues, meaning they are unavailable to be used for troubleshooting. The encryption
                keys for these archives are stored in a secure location with protected access.</li>
            <li>Log files are never stored on equipment not owned by Benrogo and all transfers between equipment are encrypted.</li>
            <li>Logs are never sold or shown to third-parties, even in the event that they are needed for troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>
