            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Benrogo started as a Bare proxy that was part of TIW to run UV-Static. In early 2024,
                Benrogo became it's own separate service, with the goal of starting a large-scale public proxy network.
                Since then I have added many new technologies and made many custom pieces of software to make the service
                into what is is now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Links are automatically collected from server logs through a reverse proxy setup
                and displayed publicly on the site for anyone to use. This helps new proxy sites find more users, helps
                bring more users to Benrogo, and makes it much easier for anyone to find unblocked proxy links! Links
                are checked every 10 minutes (huge pain to code btw) to see if they're online so you never have to
                check links yourself!
            </p>
